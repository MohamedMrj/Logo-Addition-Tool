# Logo Addition Tool

The Logo Addition Tool is a Python script that allows you to easily add a logo to images and videos in a specified folder. It supports various image and video formats and can handle both transparent and non-transparent logos. The script utilizes the popular `Pillow` library for image processing and `moviepy` library for video editing.

## Features

- Add a logo to images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.) and videos (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.).
- Automatically handle transparent logos (PNG with alpha channel) for smooth blending.
- Resize the logo to a desired size while maintaining aspect ratio.
- Position the logo on the media (e.g., top left corner).
- Save the processed media with the logo in the output directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `Pillow` library (for image processing)
- `moviepy` library (for video editing)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```
pip install Pillow moviepy
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Prepare your logo image (preferably in PNG format with a transparent background) and place it in a location accessible to the script.

3. Create a folder containing the images and videos to which you want to add the logo.

4. Open the `logoOnImages.py` script using a text editor.

5. Update the following variables in the script with appropriate paths:

   ```python
   media_folder = 'path/to/your/media_folder'  # Folder containing your images/videos
   logo_path = 'path/to/your/logo.png'         # Path to the logo image
   output_dir = 'path/to/your/output_dir'      # Output directory for processed media
   ```

6. Save the changes and close the text editor.

7. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the location of the `logoOnImages.py` script.

8. Run the script using the following command:

   ```
   python logoOnImages.py
   ```

   The script will process the images and videos in the specified `media_folder`, add the logo, and save the processed media with the logo in the `output_dir`.

## Example

Here's an example usage of the Logo Addition Tool:

```python
# Example usage
media_folder = 'C:/Users/YourUserName/Pictures/Media'      # Folder containing your images/videos
logo_path = 'C:/Users/YourUserName/Pictures/logo.png'      # Path to the logo image
output_dir = 'C:/Users/YourUserName/Pictures/Processed'   # Output directory for processed media

add_logo_to_media(media_folder, logo_path, output_dir)
```

In this example, the script will process the media in the `Media` folder, add the `logo.png` to each image and video, and save the processed media with the logo in the `Processed` folder.

Feel free to customize the paths and sizes according to your specific requirements.
